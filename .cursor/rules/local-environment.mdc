## Output Rules
- Do NOT use LaTeX format — not rendered properly. Use markdown instead.
- Do not generate intermediate markdown files unless explicitly asked; use `agent_memory/` for scratch.

## Local Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11, **Hardware**: 64GB RAM, RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM), Ryzen 9 5900HX
- Use PowerShell for local runs, not bash. Double-quote paths with spaces.
- Python 3.12 via Poetry. Always run: `poetry run python <script> [args]`
