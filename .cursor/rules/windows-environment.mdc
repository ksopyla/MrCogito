# Your rule content
- You are working on windows 11 development environment so when using tools and commands use windows specific, do not use any command or tool for linux or macos
- project is using Python 3.12 and poetry for managing the packages
- python packages are managed by poetry and are in [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) file, before installation check if it has been already installed
- project poetry environment is called mrcogito-sHhaXiEk-py3.12, if you want run python code run in within this virtual environment, below are the details with location
- when run some python code you must run it inside the poetry virual environment, use `poetry shell` command to enter to proper envronment or similar, below there are detials about my virtual environment
  
```poershell
poetry env info
                                                                                                  
Virtualenv
Python:         3.12.6

```

Root project folder on my windows machine is `C:\Users\krzys\Documents\Projects\MrCogito`

**Key Folders:**
- `Cache/` - Root folder for all cached data like models, datasets, and generated outputs
    - `Models/` - Folder for downloaded HuggingFace models and checkpoints
    - `Tokenizers/` - Folder for trained morphological and standard tokenizers
    - `Datasets/` - Folder for cached training datasets  
    - `Evaluation_reports/` - Folder for CSV evaluation results [[memory:2369370]]
    - `Training/` - Folder for training artifacts and logs
- `docs/` - Folder for documentation and research notes, where I keep reserach ideas, list of publication with summary,  experiments results and descriptions, here you can find all context materials for the projects, 
- `nn/` - Folder for the main implementation of the concept encoder model
- `playground/` - Folder for testing and prototyping code, here you can find code snippetes, smaller jupyter notebooks that is not part of the main implementation but is used for testing and prototyping
- `scripts/` - Folder for powershell, bash and other scripts that are used for training and evaluation,
- `training/` - Folder for training python code and utilities, here you can find the main training python code and utilities for training the concept encoder model
- `wandb/` - Folder for wandb logs and artifacts, here you can find the logs and artifacts for the training runs
