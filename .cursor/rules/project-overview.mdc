## 🎯 Project Overview  
A research project developing "Concept Encoder and decoder" - a transformer architecture using concept embeddings that try to encode informationtion, gather it from many text or audio tokens. My ultimate goal is to develop a model that can understand and generate text and audio in a coherent way.

Project description:
A research project developing "Concept Encoder and decoder" - a transformer architecture using concept embeddings that try to encode informationtion, gather it from many text or audio tokens. My ultimate goal is to develop a model that can understand and generate text and audio in a coherent way.

Project short-term goals:
- Develop a transformer architecture using concept-level token masking for better text understanding and longer context processing.
- Find the best way to encode the information from the text or audio tokens into the concept embeddings.
- Find the best tokenization strategy for the text or audio tokens.
- Train the concept encoder via MLM task as a quick way to verify the concepts idea is working.
- Find the best way to decode the concept embeddings into the text or audio tokens.
- Put the concept encoder and decoder together and train the model on the text or audio tokens.
