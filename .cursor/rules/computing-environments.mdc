## Local Windows 11 Development Environment

- OS: Windows 11
- laptopt with 64GB RAM and 1TB SSD
- GPU: RTX 3080 lapgop GPU
- CPU: Amd Ryzen 9 5900HX 
- hostname: jupyter (krzysztof's laptop)

- You are working on windows 11 development environment so when using tools and commands use windows specific, do not use any command or tool for linux or macos
- project is using Python 3.12 and poetry for managing the packages
- python packages are managed by poetry and are in [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) file, before installation check if it has been already installed
- project poetry environment is called mrcogito-sHhaXiEk-py3.12, if you want run python code run in within this virtual environment, below are the details with location
- when run some python code you must run it inside the poetry virual environment, use `poetry shell` command to enter to proper envronment or similar, below there are detials about my virtual environment
  
```poershell
poetry env info
                                                                                                  
Virtualenv
Python:         3.12.6
Implementation: CPython
Path:           C:\Users\krzys\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\mrcogito-sHhaXiEk-py3.12
Executable:     C:\Users\krzys\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\mrcogito-sHhaXiEk-py3.12\Scripts\python.exe
Valid:          True
```

Root project folder on my windows machine is `C:\Users\krzys\Documents\Projects\MrCogito`
**Environment**: Windows + Poetry virtual environment `mrcogito-sHhaXiEk-py3.12`
