**user**: could you extract and summrize the evaluation protocol for publication available at this url https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09992 


[Timestamp: 2025/03/10 20:16:46]

**ai**: The evaluation protocol for the LLaDA model, as described in the paper, involves assessing its scalability, in-context learning, instruction-following, and reversal reasoning capabilities. Here's a summary:

1.  **Scalability:**
    *   Evaluated by comparing LLaDA's performance against self-constructed Autoregressive Model (ARM) baselines.
    *   Models were trained on the same data with increasing computational FLOPs.
    *   Performance was measured on six standard tasks.

2.  **In-Context Learning and Instruction-Following:**
    *   LLaDA 8B was compared with existing LLMs of similar scale on 15 popular benchmarks, covering general tasks, mathematics, code, and Chinese language understanding.
    *   Representative LLMs were re-evaluated in the authors' implementation for a direct comparison.
    *   Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to improve instruction-following capabilities, and the performance of the fine-tuned LLaDA was compared against other LLMs.

3.  **Reversal Reasoning:**
    *   The model's ability to handle the reversal curse was quantified using a dataset of 496 famous Chinese poem sentence pairs.
    *   Models were tasked with generating the subsequent (forward) or preceding (reversal) line of a poem without additional fine-tuning.

4.  **Ablation Studies:**
    *   Ablation studies were conducted to analyze the impact of different remasking strategies (random remasking, lowest confidence remasking, and semi-autoregressive remasking) and the number of sampling steps on performance.
    *   Ablation studies on the generated length were also performed.

5.  **Benchmarks:**
    *   **General Ability:** MMLU, BBH, ARC-C, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, WinoGrande, PIQA.
    *   **Math and Science Ability:** GSM8K, Math, GPQA.
    *   **Code Generation:** HumanEval, HumanEval-FIM, MBPP.
    *   **Chinese Understanding:** CMMLU, C-Eval.

6.  **Evaluation Process:**
    *   Conditional likelihood estimation and conditional generation were the primary evaluation methods.
    *   For conditional likelihood estimation, the lm-evaluation-harness framework was used.
    *   For conditional generation, an internal library was used for evaluation.
    *   Monte Carlo estimation was used to approximate conditional likelihood.
    *   Unsupervised classifier-free guidance was applied to balance alignment with prompts and text diversity.

7.  **iGSM Dataset:**
    *   The mathematical capabilities of LLaDA were further assessed using the iGSM dataset, a synthetic GSM8K-like dataset.

In summary, the evaluation protocol involved a combination of standard benchmarks, ablation studies, and comparison against existing LLMs to comprehensively assess LLaDA's capabilities across various tasks and settings.

**user**: could you extract and summrise the evaluation protocol from appendix, for publication available at this url https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09992
could you figure out which evaluation and benchmarking framework they use
[Timestamp: 2025/03/10 20:19:44]

**ai**: Okay, let's extract and summarize the evaluation protocol details specifically from the appendix of the paper, and identify any evaluation frameworks used.

Based on the content provided, here's a summary of the evaluation protocol details found in the appendix:

*   **Appendix B.1 (Details of SFT Data):**
    *   Dynamic sequence length during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used.
    *   `|EOS|` tokens are appended to short pairs to ensure equal sequence lengths within each mini-batch.
    *   These `|EOS|` tokens are treated as part of the response during training (i.e., masked and included in the training objective) but are removed during sampling/generation.
    *   For n-turn dialogues, they are treated as n single-turn dialogue pairs, and one is randomly sampled.

*   **Appendix B.2 (Architectures and Scaling Experiments):**
    *   Details on the architectures of the ARM and MDM models used in scaling experiments are provided.
    *   Transformer architecture similar to LLaMA is used for both ARMs and MDMs.
    *   RMSNorm is used to stabilize training.
    *   SwiGLU is used as the activation function.
    *   RoPE is integrated for positional encoding.
    *   The 6N*D formulation is used to calculate training FLOPs.

*   **Appendix B.3 (Details and Ablation on Remasking):**
    *   Details on inference methods and ablation studies on remasking strategies are provided.
    *   For the instruct model, semi-autoregressive remasking is used to avoid unnatural occurrences of `|EOS|` tokens. The generation length is divided into blocks, and each block is generated from left to right.
    *   GSM8K accuracy is used as the performance metric in ablation studies.

*   **Appendix B.4 (Ablation on Generated Length):**
    *   Ablation studies on generated length are conducted using GSM8K as the evaluation metric.
    *   The number of sampling steps is set to half of the generated length.

*   **Appendix B.5 (Standard Benchmarks and Evaluation):**
    *   Details on the benchmarks used are provided:
        *   **General Ability:** MMLU, BBH, ARC-C, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, WinoGrande, PIQA.
        *   **Math and Science Ability:** GSM8K, Math, GPQA.
        *   **Code Generation:** HumanEval, HumanEval-FIM, MBPP.
        *   **Chinese Understanding:** CMMLU, C-Eval.
    *   Evaluation methods include conditional likelihood estimation and conditional generation.
    *   For conditional likelihood estimation, the `lm-evaluation-harness` framework is used.
    *   For conditional generation, an internal library is used.
    *   Monte Carlo estimation is used to approximate Eq. (6) for conditional likelihood estimation.
    *   Unsupervised classifier-free guidance is applied.

*   **Appendix B.6 (Analysis of Sampling Steps):**
    *   The impact of sampling steps is analyzed using the LLaDA 8B Base model on GSM8K and HumanEval datasets.

*   **Appendix B.7 (Evaluation on iGSM Dataset):**
    *   The mathematical capabilities are assessed using the iGSM dataset.

*   **Appendix B.8 (Poem Completion Tasks):**
    *   Examples from the poem completion dataset are provided.

*   **Appendix B.9 (More Case Studies):**
    *   Additional case studies are presented.

**Evaluation and Benchmarking Frameworks:**

*   **`lm-evaluation-harness`**: This framework is explicitly mentioned as being used for datasets evaluated with conditional likelihood estimation.
*   **Internal Library**: The paper mentions relying on an internal library for datasets evaluated with conditional generation, as `lm-evaluation-harness` lacks implementations for certain key metrics (e.g., HumanEval-FIM).

In summary, the appendix provides detailed information on data processing, model architectures, ablation studies, specific benchmark details, and the evaluation frameworks used. The primary framework identified is `lm-evaluation-harness`, supplemented by an internal library for tasks not covered by the harness.
